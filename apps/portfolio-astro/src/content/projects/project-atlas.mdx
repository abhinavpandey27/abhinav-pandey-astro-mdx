## Building the narrative flow

<Callout title="Motion principle" tone="highlight">
Motion threads every interaction together while staying respectful of reduced-motion preferences. Pauses and easing communicate pacing instead of raw velocity.
</Callout>

<OutcomeMetric label="Case study completion" value="92%" description="Reviewers reached the final section when motion cues guided the storyline." emphasis="accent" align="center" />

The Atlas storyline was written directly in Tina, letting the team stage callouts and metrics alongside gallery imagery. Designers could update the narrative while previewing how metrics landed within the project canvas.
