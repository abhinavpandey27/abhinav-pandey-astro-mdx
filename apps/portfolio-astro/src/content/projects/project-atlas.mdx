Designers used Atlas to choreograph multi-sensory launch rituals. This starter narrative shows how to structure a project story with motion-aware frontmatter.

## Collaboration Themes

- Anchor each section with a clear outcome the reader cares about.
- Pair every motion directive with a reduced-motion alternative noted in prose.

## Media Notes

Replace the placeholder assets (`../media/placeholder.png`) with exported JPG or PNG files that live alongside this content entry. Keep filenames kebab-cased so Tina and Astro can process them.
