## Building a new fantasy system from scratch

The Striker project required designing a completely new player-card-based fantasy system from the ground up. Working under high ambiguity with rapid iteration cycles, I designed and tested core UX patterns that would scale across multiple product surfaces.

The challenge was making complex NFT and Web3 concepts accessible to mainstream cricket fans while maintaining the excitement and engagement of traditional fantasy sports. Through careful information architecture and progressive disclosure, we created an experience that educated users without overwhelming them.
