## Redefining dating app experiences

<Callout title="Design principle" tone="highlight">
Dating apps had reduced matchmaking to gamification rather than real-life compatibility exploration. Reve helps skip the talking stage and actually go out on real dates.
</Callout>

<OutcomeMetric label="VC Commitment" value="$1.5M USD" description="Soft commitment from Tier-1 VC" emphasis="accent" align="center" />

As Founding Product and Design Lead, I led end-to-end product, UX, visual and brand execution for Reve. The app challenges the traditional dating app model by focusing on real-world connections from the start.

Reve uses structured date planning, voice-based interactions, and a unique algorithm that prioritizes compatibility over endless swiping. Users create date invitations, respond to matches, and coordinate real-world meetups—all designed to reduce friction and increase actual dates.
