## Redesigning social around IRL connections

<Callout title="Product vision" tone="highlight">
Converted passive consumption to active participation through prompt-led, interest-driven discovery in a location-first, voice-based social app.
</Callout>

<OutcomeMetric label="VC Commitment" value="$5M USD" description="Soft commitment from Tier-1 investors" emphasis="accent" align="center" />

As Founding Product and Design Lead, I owned the complete product definition, UX, and visual design from scratch. The goal was to create a new kind of social app that prioritized real-world connections over digital-only interactions.

Spilll reimagines social media by combining location-first discovery with voice-based content creation. The app uses prompts and interest graphs to guide users toward creating meaningful content that connects them with people and places around them.
