As a Product Design Intern, I worked on designing and shipping core UX and final UI for MPL Fantasy Pro's real-time team trading feature. The challenge was creating an intuitive interface for a completely new concept in fantasy sports.

The system balanced gamification, education, and monetization through a clean, mobile-first design approach. Users could discover teams, filter by various criteria, place bids, and complete transactions—all while matches were live, creating an engaging and dynamic experience.
