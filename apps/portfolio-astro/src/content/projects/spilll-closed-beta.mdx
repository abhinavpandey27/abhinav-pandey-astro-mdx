## Building an audio-first social experience

<Callout title="Design goal" tone="highlight">
The goal was to keep the experience fun and distinct from conventional social apps while building a prompt-based audio-social platform.
</Callout>

<OutcomeMetric label="Spills Created" value="1,700+" description="In just 5 weeks" emphasis="accent" align="center" />

As founding Product and Design Lead, I worked across the complete product scope from product definition, interaction design, to final visual execution. Spilll was designed to be a playful, engaging alternative to traditional social media.

The app launched to 15+ Delhi Campuses, reaching 3500 installs with an impressive 10m 45s average session time. The unique nickname generation flow, prompt-based content creation, and circle features created a distinct social experience that resonated with college students.
